# Using Pointer

1. Create a dummy node and set it as current node
2. Iterate thorigh 2 lists
   1. If the list1 value is less than list2, set it the next node for the current node
   2. Change the current node to it's next node

Time Complexity: O(n), n is the max length of the 2 list

Space Complexity: O(1)
