# Using Pointer

1. Set pointer to first position
2. Iterate through the array from 2nd position and for each element:
   1. if the element is not equal to the number pointed by the pointer then just increase the pointer and replace the value pointed by the pointer with the current iterated element

Time Complexity: O(n), n is the length of the array

Space Complexity: O(1)
